# RapidRx Worker

This is a worker for the RapidRx project. It is responsible for processing data and then returning it in a suitable format.

This project uses cloudflare workers and the OpenAI API to run and parse/format data into a readable and usable format.

It occasionally fails for reasons unknown to me but I'm working to fix it.
